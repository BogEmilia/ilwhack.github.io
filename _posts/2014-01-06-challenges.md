# Challenges

[page still under construction!]

## How to win

You will be judged along the following dimensions:

* Novelty (how original is your idea?)
* Execution (how well does your project function and do what it should?)
* Design (how visually appealing / user friendly is your project?)
* Business potential (how well have you developed a viable business case for your project?)
* Teamwork (how well did you work together and distribute tasks?)

You don’t need to score points in all of these, but the more you do the better you’re project is likely to be. That’s why it might be helpful to have a team of people from mixed backgrounds &mdash; programmers, designers and business people &mdash; all working together. But if you don’t have a mixed team, you can make up a shortfall in one dimension by doing really well in another.

## Themes

Use of the particular themes will be taken into account by the people judging your project, so you might have more chance of winning a prize if you work on something in one or more of these areas. THis year's themes are being finalised, but are likely to include:

* Neighbourhoods and communities
* Health, well-being and the environment
* Data visualisation
* Student experience

### City of Edinburgh Council


#### What do you think of the Council?

The Council maintains a large number of social media accounts (Twitter and Facebook). Can we use text analytic techniques (such as sentiment detection) over data from these accounts to build a picture of what are hot topics? Most interesting are likely to be Corporate accounts, Libraries, Transport and Neighbourhoods.

#### A civic dashboard for Edinburgh

A civic data dashboard is a way of aggregating data about an adminstrative area and presenting it in a useful, engaging and informative manner for residents. Can we build one for Edinburgh?

Can we use data from social media and news media to build a picture of such innovations in and around Nairobi, Kenya? And how can we present this data in an informative and scalable manner?
**Key Datasets**: The team will have to find and identify appropriate APIs/data sets from social media used in Kenya and news media sources.

### Scottish Government Analytical Services

#### Interpreting the Scottish Household Survey

What does the Scottish Household Survey tell us about the people of Scotland? How would you present this information to Scottish Government Ministers to help them make spending decisions or introduce new policies? Alternatively how would you present this information to the general public so that they can see how well the Scottish Government is meeting the National Outcomes in the National Performance Framework? Can we enrich the picture by including other data published by the Scottish Government and others?


The Scottish Household Survey collects a wealth of data about the people of Scotland, but is not disseminated as widely as it should be. The main way of making the data available is via a 212 page  report: <http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/0045/00457570.pdf>

**Key Datasets**:   

* Local Authority Tables Excel data: <http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Statistics/16002/LATables-2013>. The data behind the tables can be accessed using dropdown menus in the "LA Raw Data" worksheet, e.g., <http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Statistics/16002/LATables-2012/2012-exceldownload>
* The National Performance Framework: <http://www.scotland.gov.uk/About/Performance/purposestratobjs>
