# Challenges

## How to win

You will be judged along the following dimensions:

* Novelty (how original is your idea?)
* Execution (how well does your project function and do what it should?)
* Design (how visually appealing / user friendly is your project?)
* Business potential (how well have you developed a viable business case for your project?)
* Teamwork (how well did you work together and distribute tasks?)

You don’t need to score points in all of these, but the more you do the better you’re project is likely to be. That’s why it might be helpful to have a team of people from mixed backgrounds &mdash; programmers, designers and business people &mdash; all working together. But if you don’t have a mixed team, you can make up a shortfall in one dimension by doing really well in another.

<!-- ## Themes

Use of the particular themes will be taken into account by the people judging your project, so you might have more chance of winning a prize if you work on something in one or more of these areas. THis year's themes are being finalised. *Last year* the themes were:

* Neighbourhoods and communities
* Health, well-being and the environment
* Travel and adventure
* Student experience
