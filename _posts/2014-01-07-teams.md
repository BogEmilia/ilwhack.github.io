# Teams

When you have formed a team and settled on a project idea, you'll need to add them to this page. **This is mandatory**. Only projects on this page will be judged. Teams can be between 1 and 6 people. Interdisciplinary teams are strongly encouraged.

## Deadlines

* Teams must be finalised by lunchtime on Tuesday.
* Projects must have complete descriptions by lunchtime on Friday.

## How

Fork [the respository for this website](https://github.com/ilwhack/ilwhack.github.io) on github (you'll need a github account), update this section at `_posts/2014-01-07-teams.md` and submit a pull request. If doing this is outwith your skillset, [file an issue](https://github.com/ilwhack/ilwhack.github.io/issues) including the information you'd like adding.

Use the following template:

### Team Name
