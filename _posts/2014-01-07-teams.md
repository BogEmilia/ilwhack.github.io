# Teams

When you have formed a team and settled on a project idea, you'll need to add them to this page. **This is mandatory**. Only projects which have fully completed entries on this page will be judged (and therefore in the running for a prize). Teams can be between 1 and 6 people. Interdisciplinary teams are strongly encouraged.

**Deadlines**

* Teams must be finalised by 13:00 on Tuesday 17th Feb.
* Projects must have complete descriptions by 13:00 on Friday 20th Feb.

**How**

Fork [the respository for this website](https://github.com/ilwhack/ilwhack.github.io) on github (you'll need a github account), update this section at `_posts/2014-01-07-teams.md` and submit a pull request (as described on [GitHub help](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)). If doing this is outwith your skillset, [file an issue](https://github.com/ilwhack/ilwhack.github.io/issues) which includes all the information specified below.

Use the following template:

#### Team Name

* Team Member Name (matric number, school): 
  *Brief summary of skills/knowledge and what you want to learn more about this week.*
* Team Member Name (matric number, school): 
  *Brief summary of skills/knowledge and what you want to learn more about this week.*
* Team Member Name (matric number, school): 
  *Brief summary of skills/knowledge and what you want to learn more about this week.*
* ..

#### Name of Team manager


#### Project Name

* **[Link to your project website](http://example.org)**
* **[Link to your project repository](http://github.com/example/example)** (We've assumed GitHub, but you could use [](https://bitbucket.org) or something else, as long as the project repository is public)

Add a brief project description here, including innovative ideas and approach, problems it's solving, technologies used, and the themes it falls under.
