# Innovation Lab + Smart Data Hack


The **Innovation Lab + Smart Data Hack** is a 5-day event during the University of Edinburgh's [Innovative Learning Week](http://www.ed.ac.uk/staff-students/students/academic-life/studies/innovative-learning/innovative-learning-week) that brings students to work together to build cool	 solutions for real-world problems. It encourages interdisciplinary teams to combine their skills in digital technology, business analysis, ethnography and design.

It is hosted by the [School of Informatics](http://www.ed.ac.uk/schools-departments/informatics/) in partnership with [The Business School](http://www.business-school.ed.ac.uk/), [The School of Design](http://www.eca.ed.ac.uk/school-of-design), [The School of Social and Political Sciences](http://www.sps.ed.ac.uk), [The Global Development Academy](http://www.ed.ac.uk/schools-departments/global-development) and [Edinburgh Living Lab](hgttp://edinburghlivinglab.org)

Last year's Smart Data Hack was a runaway success, and this year we are expanding the event by including more challenges from more partners!

## When and where?

It's happening from Mon 16th to Fri 20th February 2015 in Appleton
Tower Levels 4 and 5.
