# Mentors


If you fancy helping students squash bugs and build great stuff during the hack week, we'd love to have you! Students will have varying levels of technical knowledge and programming experience, so it's really important that there's plenty of opportunity for them to learn. We're looking for people with appropriate skills to mentor students or deliver short workshops over the course of the week. Useful topics include:

 *  Frontend web app stuff (HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, mobile-first development)
 *  Web and app user interface design
 *  Native app programming (Android, iOS)
 *  Server-side stuff (PHP, Python, Ruby, and relevant frameworks)
 *  Data wrangling, visualisation and analysis
 *  Linked Data or Semantic Web technologies
 *  User experience / design
 *  Business plans, pitching
 *  Idea generation, presentation skills

Mentors are welcome to spend as much or as little time as they like present during the week. The hacking will take place on the 3rd, 4th and 5th floors of Appleton Tower.

Snacks and meals included! (If you're around at lunchtime).

## Information for Students

Students, if you get stuck during the week, you can ask mentors for help. They'll be listed here, with their skills, closer to the time.
